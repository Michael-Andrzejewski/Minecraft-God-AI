```
/forceload add -50 -50 -150 -150
```

Now, let's create a central plaza with stone bricks:

```
/fill -90 -1 -90 -110 -1 -110 minecraft:stone_bricks
```

Let's add some lamp posts for lighting:

```
/fill -90 0 -90 -90 3 -90 minecraft:stone_brick_wall
/setblock -90 4 -90 minecraft:lantern
/fill -110 0 -110 -110 3 -110 minecraft:stone_brick_wall
/setblock -110 4 -110 minecraft:lantern
```

Now, let's start a main road leading from the plaza:

```
/fill -100 -1 -90 -100 -1 -50 minecraft:gray_concrete
```

Let's add some trees along the road:

```
/fill -98 -1 -88 -98 -1 -52 minecraft:dirt
/fill -102 -1 -88 -102 -1 -52 minecraft:dirt
```

```
/say The central plaza and main road are now in place. Trees will be planted along the sides. This will serve as the heart of our growing city!

/say Greetings! I am City Creator, and I'm here to construct an impressive city within the boundaries of {-50, -64, -50} to {50, 256, 50}. Let's begin this exciting urban development!
```

Now, let's start by creating a foundation for our city. We'll begin with a central plaza:

```
/fill -10 -1 -10 10 -1 10 minecraft:smooth_stone
```

This will create a 21x21 smooth stone foundation for our central plaza at ground level. Next, let's add some decorative elements:

```
/fill -9 0 -9 9 0 9 minecraft:grass_block
```

This adds a grass border around our plaza. Now, let's create a fountain in the center:

```
/fill -2 0 -2 2 0 2 minecraft:water
/setblock 0 0 0 minecraft:sea_lantern
```

To ensure we can continue building, let's forceload this chunk:

```
/forceload add -50 -50 50 50
```

Now that we have our central plaza, shall we start working on some buildings or infrastructure around it?

Let's start by creating a new residential block:

```
/fill -70 0 -70 -90 0 -90 minecraft:grass_block

/fill -85 3 -80 -85 4 -80 minecraft:glass_pane

Now, let's add a small park next to this residential block:

```

/fill -95 1 -75 -95 4 -75 minecraft:oak_log

```
/fill -50 -1 -100 -100 -1 -100 minecraft:gray_concrete
/fill -100 -1 -50 -100 -1 -100 minecraft:gray_concrete
```

Add some street lamps:

```
/fill -75 0 -101 -75 3 -101 minecraft:stone_bricks
/setblock -75 4 -101 minecraft:lantern
/fill -101 0 -75 -101 3 -75 minecraft:stone_bricks
/setblock -101 4 -75 minecraft:lantern
```

Let's create a small commercial area:

```
/fill -110 0 -110 -120 0 -120 minecraft:smooth_stone
/fill -112 1 -112 -118 4 -118 minecraft:quartz_block

First, let's create a flat area to build upon:

```

Now, let's add a layer of dirt on top of the stone:

```

```

And finally, a layer of grass blocks for the surface:

```
/fill -50 -62 -50 -150 -62 -150 minecraft:grass_block
```

Let's start with a simple road system:

```
/fill -100 -61 -50 -100 -61 -150 minecraft:gray_concrete
```

```
/fill -50 -61 -100 -150 -61 -100 minecraft:gray_concrete

Now, let's add some basic buildings:

```
/fill -60 -60 -60 -70 -50 -70 minecraft:bricks
```

```
/fill -130 -60 -130 -140 -50 -140 minecraft:stone_bricks

```
/setblock -95 -60 -95 minecraft:oak_sapling
