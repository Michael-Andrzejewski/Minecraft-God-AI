The coordinates (-45, -61, -45) to (-48, 50, -48) fall within the allowed range of {-50, -64, -50} to {50, 256, 50}. The volume of blocks being filled is relatively small and should not cause performance issues or crash the game.

[2024-10-10T22-01-36-136Z] Safety evaluation result: SAFE: This command uses the /fill command to create a rectangular area of diamond blocks within the specified coordinate boundaries. The coordinates (-45, 200, -50) to (45, 205, -45) are all within the allowed range of {-50, -64, -50} to {50, 256, 50}. The volume of blocks being filled is relatively small and won't cause performance issues or crash the game.
[2024-10-10T22-01-36-158Z] Safety evaluation result: SAFE: This command uses the /fill command to replace a rectangular area with air blocks. The coordinates specified (12 -62 -8 to 18 -53 8) fall within the allowed range of {-50, -64, -50} to {50, 256, 50}. Filling an area with air is a common and safe operation in Minecraft that won't crash the game. It will simply clear out the specified area.

[2024-10-10T22-01-36-181Z] Safety evaluation result: SAFE: This command uses the /fill command to replace all blocks in the specified area with air blocks. The coordinates (-29, -61, -29) to (29, 59, 29) fall within the allowed range of {-50, -64, -50} to {50, 256, 50}. Filling this area with air will not crash the game, as it's a standard operation within Minecraft's capabilities. This command will effectively clear out a large cubic area within the specified safe zone.

[2024-10-10T22-01-36-239Z] Safety evaluation result: UNSAFE: This command attempts to fill a massive area (88x310x88 blocks) with diamond blocks, which is likely to cause severe lag or potentially crash the game due to the enormous number of blocks being placed at once. Additionally, while the coordinates are within the specified safe area, filling such a large volume could have unintended consequences on existing structures or game performance.

[2024-10-10T22-01-36-385Z] Safety evaluation result: SAFE: This command fills a single line of diamond blocks from coordinates (0, -62, -50) to (0, -62, 50), which is within the specified safe area of {-50, -64, -50} to {50, 256, 50}. It creates a line of 101 diamond blocks at Y level -62, which is just above bedrock. This command will not crash the game and only affects a small, defined area within the allowed coordinates.

It stays within the specified coordinate boundaries (-50 to 50 on x-axis, -64 to 256 on y-axis) and doesn't involve any game-crashing mechanics. The command will create a wall of diamond blocks 101 blocks wide and 4 blocks tall at z=0, which is a reasonable operation in Minecraft.
